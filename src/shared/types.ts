/**
 * The KYBER Studio domain model.
 *
 * Studio is the customer's console for agents that already exist. Agents run
 * where they were deployed — Vercel, exe.dev, a client VM — and Studio is a
 * door onto them alongside Slack and iMessage, not a replacement for either.
 *
 * Chat is the front door, but the app is not read-only: connections, channels,
 * routines, instructions, and agent identity are all managed here, because a
 * customer who lives in this app should never be told to go open a terminal to
 * connect Gmail or add Slack. What it deliberately does NOT do is scaffold and
 * deploy a new agent from nothing — that stays with `kyb init` and the FDE.
